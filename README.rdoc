= Moonshine_Memcached

=== A plugin for Moonshine[http://github.com/railsmachine/moonshine]

A plugin for installing and managing memcached.

Look through the <tt>memcached.conf.erb</tt> template to see available options.
No client gem is installed unless specified, the default is the version bundled
with Rails.

=== Security Note

Memcached does not implement its own authentication or authorization measures.
This plugin sets up the daemon to only listen on the local interface by default
(via the <tt>:listen_address</tt> configuration key), so if you need to change
this it is strongly advised that you configure iptables rules to restrict
access to the hosts that need it. The moonshine_iptables[http://github.com/railsmachine/moonshine_iptables]
plugin is a handy way to do this.

=== Instructions

* <tt>script/plugin install git://github.com/railsmachine/moonshine_memcached.git</tt>
* Configure settings if needed:
    configure(:memcached => { 
      :max_memory => '256',     # default is 64
      :client => '1.7.2',
      :enable_on_boot => false  # maybe you want god to start it instead of init
    })
* Include the plugin and recipe(s) in your Moonshine manifest:
    recipe :memcached
